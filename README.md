# CS-4395-Assignment2
In this project we will consider neural networks: first a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and second a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for performing a 5-class Sentiment Analysis task.

To run:

python ffnn.py/rnn.py --hidden_dim [hparam] --epochs [hparam]
--train_data [train data path] --val_data [val data path]
